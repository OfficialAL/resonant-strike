# Resonant Strike - Controls Reference

## 🥋 Stationary Wing Chun Combat

**Important: You remain stationary! Enemies come to you. Master stance transitions and technique timing to win.**

## Wing Chun Stances (W/A/S/D)

| Key | Stance | Color | Wing Chun Meaning | Combat Application |
|-----|--------|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **W** | **Bong Sau** | Red | Wing arm deflection | Deflects attacks from above and outside |
| **A** | **Tan Sau** | Blue | Dispersing hand | Redirects incoming force away |
| **S** | **Wu Sau** | Green | Protecting hand | Guards centerline and vital areas |
| **D** | **Chi Sau** | Yellow | Sticky hands | Maintains contact for sensitivity |

## Wing Chun Techniques (I/J/K/L)

| Key | Technique | Wing Chun Meaning | Combat Effect |
|-----|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **I** | **Chain Punch** | Straight-line power strikes | Forward energy wave with penetrating force |
| **J** | **Tan Da** | Deflect and counter simultaneously | Diagonal energy wave with redirecting power |
| **K** | **Lap Sau** | Grab and strike combination | Grappling energy wave that controls opponent |
| **L** | **Pak Sau** | Quick deflection and opening | Quick burst energy wave for creating openings |

## Control Philosophy

### Traditional Wing Chun Principles
- **Centerline Theory:** All techniques protect and attack along the body's centerline
- **Economy of Motion:** Shortest distance between two points
- **Simultaneous Attack and Defense:** Tan Da embodies this principle
- **Sensitivity:** Chi Sau develops tactile awareness

### Game Implementation
- **Stance First:** Choose your defensive position with W/A/S/D
- **Technique Second:** Execute your attack with I/J/K/L
- **Energy Follows:** Visual energy waves show internal power flow
- **Range Matters:** Close-quarters combat honors Wing Chun distance

## Combat Flow

### Basic Sequence
1. **Assess Enemy:** Watch for attack telegraphs
2. **Choose Stance:** Select appropriate Wing Chun stance (W/A/S/D)
3. **Execute Technique:** Perform Wing Chun technique (I/J/K/L)
4. **Channel Energy:** Energy wave creation based on stance/technique combination
5. **Maintain Distance:** Stay in Wing Chun range for effectiveness

### Advanced Combinations

#### Defensive Combinations
- **Wu Sau + Pak Sau (S + L):** Protect centerline then create opening
- **Tan Sau + Tan Da (A + J):** Redirect force then counter-attack
- **Bong Sau + Chain Punch (W + I):** Deflect high attack then straight punch

#### Offensive Combinations
- **Chi Sau + Lap Sau (D + K):** Maintain contact then grab and strike
- **Bong Sau + Tan Da (W + J):** Wing deflection into simultaneous counter
- **Wu Sau + Chain Punch (S + I):** Centerline protection into power strike

## Energy Wave System

### Color Coding
- **Red Waves (Bong Sau):** Power and deflection energy
- **Blue Waves (Tan Sau):** Flow and redirection energy  
- **Green Waves (Wu Sau):** Balance and protection energy
- **Yellow Waves (Chi Sau):** Sensitivity and connection energy

### Visual Effects
- **Metallic Properties:** Enhanced materials with 0.3 metallic value
- **Rim Lighting:** Dramatic edge highlighting for energy visibility
- **Emission Glow:** 2x emission multiplier for energy intensity
- **Low Roughness:** 0.2 roughness for smooth energy flow appearance

## Camera System

### First-Person Perspective
- **Immersive View:** Experience Wing Chun from practitioner's perspective
- **Eye Level Position:** Camera at 1.6m height for realistic viewpoint
- **Hand Visualization:** Left and right hand spheres show stance positioning
- **Stance Indicator:** Visual indicator shows current stance state

### Visual Feedback
- **Stance Indicator Position:** 0.3m below eye level, 1m forward
- **Hand Sphere Positions:** Left (-0.3, -0.2, -0.8), Right (0.3, -0.2, -0.8)
- **Color Changes:** Real-time stance color updates for immediate feedback

## Input Response

### Stance Changes (Immediate)
- **W/A/S/D:** Instant stance switching with visual color update
- **Color Feedback:** Immediate stance indicator color change
- **Hand Positioning:** Subtle hand sphere repositioning for each stance

### Technique Execution (Triggered)
- **I/J/K/L:** Technique execution with energy wave creation
- **Timing Window:** Brief execution window for technique effectiveness
- **Energy Creation:** Visible energy wave spawns based on current stance

## Combat Range

### Wing Chun Distance
- **Optimal Range:** 1.5-2.5 meters from opponent
- **Close Quarters:** Wing Chun excels in close-range combat
- **Centerline Control:** Maintain position along central fighting line
- **Footwork Minimal:** Wing Chun emphasizes rooted stances over movement

### Environmental Awareness
- **Arena Boundaries:** Stay within traditional dojo mat area
- **Enemy Positioning:** Observe enemy stance and telegraph patterns
- **Energy Wave Paths:** Track energy wave trajectories for effectiveness

## Tips for Mastery

### Stance Selection
- **Bong Sau (W):** Use against high attacks and overhead strikes
- **Tan Sau (A):** Redirect horizontal attacks and side approaches
- **Wu Sau (S):** Default protective stance for centerline defense
- **Chi Sau (D):** Advanced sensitivity for close-contact situations

### Technique Timing
- **Chain Punch (I):** Best for direct confrontation and power
- **Tan Da (J):** Perfect for simultaneous defense and counter
- **Lap Sau (K):** Effective for controlling aggressive opponents
- **Pak Sau (L):** Quick response for creating attack opportunities

### Energy Management
- **Stance Influences Color:** Choose stance to match desired energy type
- **Technique Influences Direction:** Select technique for optimal energy path
- **Combination Effects:** Experiment with stance/technique combinations
- **Visual Clarity:** Enhanced materials make energy patterns clearly visible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No Response:** Ensure proper key timing between stance and technique
- **Wrong Colors:** Verify stance selection before technique execution
- **Weak Energy:** Maintain close-quarters range for optimal effectiveness
- **Poor Timing:** Practice telegraph recognition for better technique timing

### Performance Tips
- **Steady Frame Rate:** Enhanced materials require stable performance
- **Visual Clarity:** Adjust graphics settings if energy waves appear unclear
- **Input Lag:** Reduce input buffer if stance changes feel delayed
- **Camera Smoothness:** Ensure stable first-person camera for immersion

The control system honors traditional Wing Chun principles while providing modern visual feedback through enhanced materials, rim lighting, and energy wave visualization, creating an authentic yet accessible martial arts gaming experience.
